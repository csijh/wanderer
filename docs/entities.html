<h1>Entities</h1>

<p>The development has reached this point, leaving out some details:</p>

<img src="levels.png" alt="The Entity class depends on Level which
depends on Grid" />

<p>The next question is whether or not an entity should know its own coordinates
in the grid.  The problem is that it involves duplicate data.  The (x,y)
coordinates stored in the entity object, and the actual position of the object
in the grid, need to be kept consistent with each other.  It is easy to imagine
a lot of code like this:</p>

<pre>grid.move(this, Right);
x++;
</pre>

<p>The first line tells the grid to move the entity to a new cell, and the
second updates the entity's coordinates to match.  The danger of inconsistency
is very real, and increases enormously as the number of code fragments like the
one above increases.  Any problems can be very tough to debug.</p>

<p>One approach is for an entity <em>not</em> to know its own coordinates.  Only
the grid knows, and can therefore carefully keep them consistent. Several
variations on this theme are possible, but two problems inevitably arise.  The
first is that the resulting system can't be described as simple or natural. The
second is that, although <em>most</em> things that an entity wants to do can be
done with directions, e.g. "move right" or "find the entity to the right" and so
on, occasionally actual coordinates come into play, e.g a long-distance
teleport, or a monster which chases the player.</p>

<p>Entities have already been split across two classes, <code>Cell</code> as a
generic base class and <code>Entity</code> for custom details. So a good
approach is for a <code>Cell</code> to know here it is, but not an
<code>Entity</code>. The <code>Cell</code> class might look like this:</p>

<pre>class Cell {
    private Grid&lt;Cell> grid;
    private int x, y;
    int x() { return x; }
    int y() { return y; }
...
}
</pre>

<p>An object of the <code>Cell</code> class knows its own coordinates, but the
class consists of a relatively small amount of stable code, so that consistency
can be kept under control. The coordinates are private, and so the
<code>Entity</code> class only has read access to them. That encapsulates the
coordinate consistency problem inside the <code>Cell</code> class.</p>

<p>The <code>Cell</code> class shown above has a weakness.  The grid field has
class <code>Grid&lt;Cell></code>.  So, when an entity finds a neighbouring
entity in the grid, it only knows that the neighbour has type <code>Cell</code>,
not <code>Entity</code> (unless it cheats by using casting, for example).  While
this isn't a disaster, it is worth making the framework class <code>Cell</code>
a bit more sophisticated, to ease the implementation of game-specific custom
classes, like this:</p>

<pre>public class Cell&lt;E extends Cell&lt;E>>
    private Grid&lt;E> grid;
    private int x, y;
    int x() { return x; }
    int y() { return y; }
...
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>Cell</code> class is given a parameter <code>E</code>, which will
later be filled in by the <code>Entity</code> class.  Then entities will be able
to access other entities using variables of class <code>Entity</code>. The
<code>E</code> parameter (which will end up referring to the <code>Entity</code>
class) must be a class which extends <code>Cell</code>. In fact, it must extend
<code>Cell&lt;E></code>, which leads to the strangely cyclic but correct class
declaration <code>class Cell&lt;E extends Cell&lt;E>></code>.</p>

<p>Implementing the <code>Cell</code> class is a bit tricky.  For example,
suppose there is a method to move this entity to the coordinates of another
entity:</p>

<pre>void move(E to) {
    ...
    x = to.x;
    y = to.y;
}
</pre>

<p>This fails because <code>to.x</code> and <code>to.y</code> are not
accessible.  The <code>to</code> variable has class <code>E</code> whereas the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields are private to the <code>Cell</code>
class.  However, any object of class <code>E</code> automatically has class
<code>Cell&lt;E></code> because of the class declaration, so the problem can be
fixed without casts or compiler warnings:</p>

<pre>void move(E e) {
    ...
    Cell&lt;E> c = e;
    x = c.x;
    y = c.y;
}
</pre>

<p>There is another problem.  Suppose there is a method:</p>

<pre>void wake() {
    grid.wake(x, y, this);
}
</pre>

<p>This fails because the variable <code>this</code> has type
<code>Cell&lt;E></code> instead of type <code>E</code>. All objects of type
<code>Cell&lt;E></code> are actually going to be of type <code>E</code>, but the
compiler doesn't know that.  A cast <code>(E)this</code> is needed, but it
causes a warning.  However, a single tiny method can be defined with the warning
suppressed:</p>

<pre>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
private E thisE() { return (E)this; }
</pre>
