<h1>Delegation</h1>

<p>Entities act mainly by delegating the work to the grid, state and queue
objects. That allows convenience methods to be defined in the <code>Cell</code>
class:</p>

<pre>class Cell&lt;E> {
    private Grid&lt;E> grid;
    private State&lt;E> state;
    private Queue&lt;E> queue;

    void wake(E e) { grid.wake(...); ... }
}
</pre>

<p>In fact, by making the grid, state and queue fields private, classes which
extend <code>Cell</code> are forced to use the convenience methods, which is a
good thing because it makes them immune from changes to the mechanics of
delegation.</p>

<p>But now we run into a problem.  How are the fields in the Cell class to be
initialised?  The normal way would be through a constructor:</p>

<pre>class Cell&lt;E> {
    Cell(Grid&lt;E> g...) { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>But that would mean each extending class would have to have a similar
constructor:</p>

<pre>class Entity extends Cell&lt;Entity> {
    Entity(Grid&lt;Entity> g...) { super(g...); }
}
</pre>

<p>That would be ugly because (a) we would like to keep custom entity classes
ultra-simple by handling as many details as possible in framework classes and
(b) custom entity classes would not be completely independent of the details of
how delegation is done.</p>

<p>A solution is to set the fields via a method rather than a
constructor:</p>

<pre>class Cell&lt;E> {
    void init(Grid&lt;E> g...) { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>Now extending classes can be kept simple.</p>
