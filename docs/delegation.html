<h1>Delegation</h1>

<p>Entities act mainly by delegating the work to the grid, state and queue
components of the level object. That allows convenience methods to be defined in
the <code>Cell</code> class:</p>

<pre>class Cell&lt;E> {
    private Level&lt;E> level;

    void wake(E e) { level.grid.wake(...); ... }
}
</pre>

<p>In fact, by making the level field private, classes which extend
<code>Cell</code> are forced to use the convenience methods, which is a good
thing because it makes them immune from the details of the level object and its
components.</p>

<p>But now we run into a problem.  How is the level field in the
<code>Cell</code> class to be initialized?  The normal way would be through a
constructor:</p>

<pre>class Cell&lt;E> {
    Cell(Level&lt;E> l) { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>But that would mean each extending class would have to have a similar
constructor:</p>

<pre>class Entity extends Cell&lt;Entity> {
    Entity(Level&lt;Entity> l) { super(g...); }
}
</pre>

<p>That would be ugly because (a) we would like to keep custom entity classes
ultra-simple by handling as many details as possible in framework classes and
(b) custom entity classes would not be completely independent of the details of
how the <code>Cell</code> class works.</p>

<p>A solution is to set the field via a method rather than a
constructor:</p>

<pre>class Cell&lt;E> {
    void init(Level&lt;E> l) { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>Now extending classes can be kept simple.</p>
