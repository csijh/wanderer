<h1>Graphics</h1>

<p>Graphics libraries are often designed to take over control of your program.
There is a danger that the graphics library may overly influence the project
design, and many developers fall into this trap.  So it is important to sort out
straight away the relationship of the graphics to the rest of the project.</p>

<p>How should a project with graphics be designed? What is the simplest thing
that works properly? There are various design patterns which apply, but they
boil down to three basic possibilities:</p>

<img src="graphics.png" alt="a model and a view (a) depending on each other,
(b) with the model depending on the view and (c) with the view depending on
the model" />

<p>The model is the collection of non-graphical classes representing the logic
of the project, and the view is the collection of graphics-related classes.</p>

<p>Possibility (a) corresponds roughly to design patterns such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-presenter">MVP</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-adapter">MVA</a>.  It can be
ruled out straight away for this project, because of the obvious cyclic
dependencies.</p>

<p>Possibility (b) corresponds roughly to design patterns such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-viewmodel">MVVM</a>.  It seems
natural, because it corresponds to the idea of creating data first, and then
displaying it afterwards.  A disadvantage for agile development is that
everything depends on graphics, making it awkward to do unit testing on the
model. For that reason, it is ruled out for this project.</p>

<p>Possibility (c) doesn't appear to correspond to any of the usual design
patterns.  Yet it is the most common, because this is the way high-level
graphics libraries are typically designed to be used.  It is the clear winner
for this project. (An interesting variation on approach (c), not explored here,
is to arrange for some objects in the model to draw themselves.)</p>

<p>So, the wanderer framework is divided into <code>model</code> components and
<code>view</code> components, with the model not depending on the view.
Development can begin with the model and its unit testing, while leaving the
view until later.</p>
