<h1>Graphics</h1>

<p>How should a program which needs a graphical user interface interact with the
graphics library?  There are various design patterns which apply, but they boil
down to three basic possibilities:</p>

<img src="graphics.png" alt="a model and a view (a) depending on each other,
(b) with the model depending on the view and (c) with the view depending on
the model" />

<p>The model is the collection of non-graphical classes representing the logic
of the project, and the view is the collection of graphics-related classes.  The
wanderer framework is divided into two packages <code>model</code> and
<code>view</code> to match.</p>

<p>Possibility (a) corresponds to design patterns such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-presenter">MVP</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-adapter">MVA</a>.  We can rule it
out straight away for this project, because of the cyclic dependencies
involved.</p>

<p>Possibility (b) corresponds to design patterns such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-viewmodel">MVVM</a>.  It is
natural, because it correponds to the idea of creating data first, and then
displaying it afterwards.  Perhaps the main disadvantage for application
development is that everything depends on graphics, making it awkward to do unit
testing.</p>

<p>Possibility (c), despite not corresponding to any of the usual design
patterns, is the most common because it is the way high-level application
graphics libraries are typically designed to be used.  It has the minor
disadvantage that it risks breaking encapsulation because the model classes have
to provide some kind of access to their internal data.  This is the pattern used
in the wanderer project.</p>

<p>The <code>view</code> package provides some general user interface classes. A
particular project need only provide a driver class which provides a top level
window and gathers together the game-specific information needed by the model
and view framework classes.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>An interesting variation on approach (c), which can eliminate the
encapsulation problem, is to arrange for some objects in the model to draw
themselves.  That might mean, for example, passing in a graphics object to draw
on.  For example, a viewable counter might be defined as:</p>

<pre>import javafx.scene.control.*;

/* A viewable counter. */
class Counter {
    private int n;
    private Label label;

    Counter(Label l) { label = l; update(); }

    void count() { n++; update(); }

    private void update() {
        if (label != null) label.setText("" + n);
    }

    private static void claim(boolean b) {
        if (!b) throw new Error("Bug");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c = new Counter(null);
        claim(c.n == 0);
        c.count();
        claim(c.n == 1);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>A class of this kind depends on the graphics library. Allowing the graphics
object to be null means that, during unit testing, no graphics objects are
created and no graphics methods are called.  As a result, the graphics system as
a whole is not started up. The unit testing in <code>main</code>
non-interactively tests the non-graphics behaviour of the class.</p>
