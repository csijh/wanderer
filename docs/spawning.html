<h1>Spawning</h1>

<p>A level needs to be able to create new entity objects of different types,
according to the character codes in textual level files.  This is tricky,
because <code>Level</code> is a framework class which knows nothing about the
entity classes.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>One possibility is to use Java's reflection facilities.  A level object is
given the names of the classes that generate the different types of entity. Then
reflection is used to create an entity object using a given class name, e.g.
like this:</p>

<pre>E e = (E) Class.forName(className).newInstance();
</pre>

<p>This will need a warning suppression.  A slight weakness of this approach is
that it requires the entity classes to be public.  To get round that, if
desired, the reflection code can be made a little more complex:</p>

<pre>Class&lt;?> c = Class.forName(t.className());
Constructor&lt;?> con = c.getDeclaredConstructor();
con.setAccessible(true);
E e = (E) con.newInstance();
</pre>

<p>However, this assumes that each type of entity is represented by a separate
class.  It would be preferable, in a framework, to provide more flexibility.</p>

<h3>Cloning</h3>

<p>Generally, developers are advised to avoid Java's cloning features.  However,
it does provide a way for framework classes to create objects of custom classes,
without using reflection.  The <code>Cell</code> class can implement the
<code>Cloneable</code> intrerface and provide a <code>clone</code> method:</p>

<pre>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public E clone() {
    try { return (E) super.clone(); }
    catch (Exception e) { throw new Error(e); }
}
</pre>

<p>Now the <code>clone</code> method can be called on any entity class, without
any specific supporting code being needed in any custom classes.  A collection
of sample entities, one of each type, can be stored in the state, and used both
by the level object and by individual entities, to spawn new entities.</p>
