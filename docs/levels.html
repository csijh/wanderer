<h1>Levels</h1>

<p>Now we want to add a Level class.  It needs to be able to read in data for
the level from a level file, and act as a driver class for all non-graphics
aspects of the game.</p>

<p>Which way round should the dependencies go?  Should <code>Cell</code> depend
on <code>Level</code>, or vice versa? Either choice is possible, with some
effort.  However, it seems better to have the <code>Level</code> class depend on
the <code>Cell</code> class, so that a level can control entities:</p>

depends on Grid" />

<p>One of the things a level object needs to do is to keep track of global
variables such as a score.  But to keep the <code>Level</code> class general, it
should be the entities which change the global variables, according to their
game-specific details.  To handle that, a generic class <code>State</code> can
be separated off from the <code>Level</code> class, and entities can be given
access to it.</p>

<p>Similarly, a level object needs to keep track of a queue of entities, to
control what order they act in.  And again, to keep <code>Level</code> general,
it should be entities which queue themselves up.  So a generic
<code>Queue</code> class can be separated out and entities given access to
it.  That leads us to a picture like this:</p>

<img src="levels2.png" alt="The Level class depends on Entity,
which depends on Grid, State and Queue" />

<p>The <code>Level</code> class can now be a framework class.  As with the other
framework classes, it needs to be generic, with a type parameter <code>E extends
Cell&lt;E></code> representing the custom <code>Entity</code> class.</p>
