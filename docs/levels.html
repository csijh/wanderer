<h1>Levels</h1>

<p>Now we want to add a Level class.  It needs to be able to read in data for
the level from a level file, and act as a driver class for all non-graphics
aspects of the game.</p>

<p>Which way round should the dependencies go?  Should <code>Cell</code> depend
on <code>Level</code>, or vice versa? Either choice is possible, with some
effort.  However, it seems better to have the <code>Level</code> class depend on
the <code>Cell</code> class, so that a level can control entities:</p>

depends on Grid" />

<p>One of the things a level object needs to do is to keep track of global
variables such as a score.  But to keep the <code>Level</code> class general, it
should be the entities which change the global variables, according to their
game-specific details.  To handle that, a generic class <code>State</code> can
be separated off from the <code>Level</code> class, and entities can be given
access to it.</p>

<p>Similarly, a level object needs to keep track of a queue of entities, to
control what order they act in.  And again, to keep <code>Level</code> general,
it should be entities which queue themselves up.  So a generic
<code>Queue</code> class can be separated out and entities given access to
it.  That leads us to a picture like this:</p>

<img src="levels2.png" alt="The Level class depends on Entity,
which depends on Grid, State and Queue" />

<p>The <code>Level</code> class can now be a framework class.  As with the other
framework classes, it needs to be generic, with a type parameter <code>E extends
Cell&lt;E></code> representing the custom <code>Entity</code> class.</p>

<p>Two aspects of the wanderer game are a little unusual.  First, instead of an
entity such as an arrow moving autonomously, it moves by triggering the space in
front of it.  This allows entities to act as stationary booby traps, only
starting to move when the player or another entity move nearby.  The other
unusual aspect is that the original program used recursion to deal with the way
in which one event triggers another.</p>

<p>For example, if you move near two objects, say an arrow and a boulder, and
set them going, the entire flight of the arrow and everything it triggers,
happens before the boulder moves.  In other words, the program is doing a
depth-first search for things to do.  It is more normal to keep a queue of
things to do, and to use it to give a more concurrent, breadth-first
physics.</p>

<p>The reconstruction uses a double ended queue, and allows entities to be added
at either end.  By adding entities at the start instead of the end, the original
game is reproduced as accurately as possible.</p>
