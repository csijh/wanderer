<h1>Levels</h1>

<p>The development has reached this point:</p>

<img src="entity.png" alt="The Entity class depending on the Grid class" />

<p>Now we want to add a Level class.  A level object reads in data from a level
file, and acts as a driver for all the non-graphics aspects of the game.</p>

<p>Which way round should the dependencies go?  Should <code>Entity</code>
depend on <code>Level</code>, or vice versa? It seems natural to make the
<code>Level</code> class into a controller, telling the entities when to
act:</p>

<img src="controller.png" alt="The Level class as a framework class depending
on the Entity and Grid classes" />

<p>On the other hand, entity classes are presumably custom classes defined for a
specific game, whereas the <code>Level</code> class could usefully be part of
the framework. A framework class should not depend on a custom class, so maybe
we should rethink.</p>

<p>The approach taken here is to define a <code>Cell</code> class as a base
class for custom entity classes, to have it be a framework class, and to allow
the <code>Level</code> class to control cells:</p>

<img src="levels.png" alt="The Entity and Level classes
depend on Cell which depends on Grid" />

<p>Besides looking after the grid, one of the things a level object needs to do
is to keep track of global variables such as a score.  But to keep the
<code>Level</code> class general, it should be the entities which change the
global variables, according to their game-specific details.  A generic class
<code>State</code> can be separated off from the <code>Level</code> class to
handle state variables.</p>

<p>Similarly, a level object needs to keep track of a queue of entities, to
control what order they act in.  And again, to keep <code>Level</code> general,
it should be entities which queue themselves up.  A generic <code>Queue</code>
class can be separated out.  That leads us to a picture like this:</p>

<img src="levels2.png" alt="he Entity and Level classes,
depend on Cell, which depends on Grid, State and Queue" />

<p>Two aspects of the wanderer game are a little unusual.  First, instead of an
entity such as an arrow moving autonomously, it moves by triggering the space in
front of it.  This allows entities to act as stationary booby traps, only
starting to move when the player or another entity moves nearby.  The other
unusual aspect is that the original program used recursion to deal with the way
in which one event triggers another.</p>

<p>For example, if you move near two objects, say an arrow and a boulder, and
set them going, the entire flight of the arrow and everything it triggers,
happens before the boulder moves.  In other words, the program is doing a
depth-first search for things to do.  It is more normal to keep a queue of
things to do, and to use it to give a more concurrent, breadth-first
physics.</p>

<p>The reconstruction uses a double ended queue, and allows entities to be added
at either end.  By adding entities at the start instead of the end, the original
game is reproduced as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>There is one more thing a level needs to be able to do.  That is to create
entities of different types, according to the data from a level file.  Entities
may also need to spawn other entities.  The creation of new entities is
something that can only be carried out when full knowledge of all the custom
entity classes is known.  So a custom factory object of some kind will need to
be passed to the level, and an interface or base class will need to be provided
for it, accessible both by the level object and entities.  Let's give the name
<code>Hatchery</code> for such a factory interface and add it to the
diagram:</p>

<img src="levels3.png" alt="The Entity and Level classes,
depend on Cell, which depends on Grid, State, Queue and Hatchery" />

<p>This is a reasonable design for the model.  The way custom classes are
intended to be designed is something like this:</p>

<img src="levels4.png" alt="A Program class, which depends on various entity
classes, which depends on the Entity base class" />

<p>There may be many specific entity classes, all inheriting from the
<code>Entity</code> class.  Each entity interacts with other entities, but only
knows that they have class <code>Entity</code>, nothing more specific, to avoid
dependencies between the classes. A <code>Program</code> class knows about all
the various entity classes, and can provide a factory for them.</p>
