<h1>Grid</h1>

<p>We are working on a grid-based game, i.e. entities move round in discrete
cells.  So the grid is a central concept.  Its most difficult issue is the
dependence between the grid and its entities.  We seem to need two cyclically
dependent classes:</p>

<img src="grid.png" alt="Classes Grid and Entity, dependent on each other" />

<p>The Grid class depends on the Entity class because the grid contains
entities.  The Entity class depends on the Grid class because each entity needs
to know where it is in the grid.</p>

<p>One possibility is to accept the cyclic dependency. That leads to
considerable awkwardnesses and complexities, not least because many more classes
join the cyclic group over time.  Another possibility is for entities to be
moved around by the grid, instead of moving themseves around. That is a direct
violation of the object oriented principle that objects should be autonomous,
looking after themselves.</p>

<p>The best approach appears to be to make the grid generic.  It is a grid of
anything, rather than a grid of entities.  To put it another way, the grid
should make no assumptions about the Entity class and, in particular, make no
method calls on entity objects.  There is no better way to express this than to
use Java's generic class facilities:</p>

<pre>class Grid&lt;E> {
}
</pre>

<p>In a way, this is odd, because the parameter <code>E</code> is only ever
going to be replaced by <code>Entity</code> and not any other class.
Nevertheless, it is the best way to get the compiler to <strong>enforce</strong>
a lack of dependence on the <code>Entity</code> class.  Defining your own
generic classes can create various problems but, with care, it makes a lot of
sense, especially for framework classes.</p>

<p>To make the grid 2.5D, we can make each cell into a list of entities from
front to back.  We are likely to want to access both the frontmost and backmost
entities, so a double-ended queue using the <code>Deque</code> class seems
easiest.  That means we want:</p>

<pre>class Grid&lt;E> {
    private Deque&lt;E>[][] cells;

    ... cells = new Deque&lt;E>[w][h];
}
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there are restrictions on Java's generics, which are a
historic result of generics being bolted onto Java relatively late on. So the
code above causes a warning message from the compiler.  It is not a good idea to
ignore the warning, because it may be hiding other problems in the code. This
is awkward to get round, but the best way seems to be this:</p>

<pre>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
private void newArray() { cells = new Deque[w][h]; }
</pre>

<p>The class <code>Deque</code> on its own is effectively
<code>Deque&lt;Object></code>.  It is worth noting that this problem with
<code>new Deque&lt;E>[w][h]</code> is not directly a result of making the grid
class generic. If we didn't make the grid class generic, the same problem would
arise with <code>new Deque&lt;Entity>[w][h]</code>. So this idiom for solving
the problem is worth knowing about.  We have achieved this:</p>

<img src="entity.png" alt="The Entity class depending on the Grid class" />

<p>One other advantage of making the grid generic, as well as solving the
dependency problem, is that it is now very clear that the grid class ought to be
general, not depending on any details of our specific game (e.g. not having a
particular fixed size). It is effectively just a two-dimensional array of lists
of objects. So the <code>Grid</code> class can be regarded as a framework
class (indicated by its green colour in the class diagram).</p>

<p>How should a blank cell in the grid be represented? A lot of programmers
would automatically use null. However, that is not very object oriented. Instead
of having code which asks each object questions or tells it to act without
knowing which kind of object it is, you have to write code which tests the
object for being null first, before deciding what to do. It is much better to
have explicit objects to represent blank cells - they are just objects with
particularly simple behaviour.</p>

<p>It might be worth noting that although using nulls is often a bad idea in
object oriented languages, it is far less of a problem in other languages. That
is because in other languages you can make a call <code>act(x)</code> and
<code>act</code> can test for <code>x</code> being null, whereas in an OO
language, you can't make the equivalent call <code>x.act()</code> without
testing for null first in the calling code.  That leads to a non-<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> repetition
of null-testing everywhere <code>act</code> is called.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>If the grid were purely 2D, we would have something like this:</p>

<pre>class Grid&lt;E> {
    private E[][] cells;

    ... cells = new E[w][h];
}
</pre>

<p>Once again, generic warnings strike and we need a workaround, like this:</p>

<pre>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
private void newArray() { cells = (E[][]) new Object[w][h]; }
</pre>

<p>Any developer can see that the cast from one type of array to another works
because the array is empty, but the compiler can't.  The
<code>SuppressWarnings</code> annotation tells the compiler that we know what we
are doing.  The annotation should be used very sparingly, and only ever applied
to a single statement or tiny method, so it is crystal clear what it applies to.
It is possible to avoid the problem using, e.g. <code>Map&lt;Position,E></code>
instead of an array, but that seems less natural than using an array. This
suppression of warnings is an unnatural idiom, but it is Java's fault, not our
fault for trying to do something too complex.</p>
