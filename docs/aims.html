<h1>Aims</h1>

<p>There is an unfortunate temptation for Java developers to over-engineer
projects.  This is despite the KISS rule of agile development ("keep it sweet
and simple").  So, throughout this project, the same question will be asked over
and over again: "what is the simplest thing that works properly?"</p>

<p>Unit testing is one of the most critical aspects of agile development, even
for a lone developer.  If you get it right, confidence and satisfaction levels
soar, as does the maximum size of project you can tackle.  The biggest problem
by far with unit testing is the psychological one of getting round to it.  So,
unit testing will be the first thing to be sorted out.</p>

<p>Graphics libraries are often designed to take over control of your program.
There is a danger that the graphics library may overly influence the project
design, with the logic not being properly separated from the graphics, and not
being properly unit tested.  So, the non-graphics logic and its unit testing
will be sorted out first, before starting on graphics.</p>

<p>An important aspect of development which is surprisingly rarely mentioned in
tutorials or textbooks or courses, is avoiding unnecessary cyclic dependencies.
If classes are cyclically dependent, they can't easily be developed or tested
independently of each other. Tools such as <a
href="https://github.com/csijh/java-depend">depend</a> or <a
href="http://www.dependency-analyzer.org/">CDA</a> can be useful to keep track
of dependencies.  So, in this project care will be taken over cyclic
dependencies.</p>

<p>A project design is often cleaner and clearer if general issues which could
potentially be reused in other projects are separated from issues which are
specific to the current project.  So, classes in this project are divided into
framework and custom classes, with framework classes not depending on custom
classes.</p>

<p>Some effort has been made to move complexities into framework classes, where
that allows custom classes to be kept simple. But, to avoid over-engineering,
the framework classes are not fully developed, polished, or documented, as they
should be if they were formed into a separate engine or library.   Other
developers can use this framework, but they will have to read the comments and
code and be prepared to adapt or upgrade the framework classes.</p>
