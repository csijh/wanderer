<h1>Aims</h1>

<p>There is an unfortunate temptation for Java developers to over-engineer
projects.  This is despite the KISS rule of agile development ("keep it sweet
and simple").  So, throughout this project, the same question will be asked over
and over again: "what is the simplest thing that works properly?"</p>

<p>Unit testing is one of the most critical aspects of agile development, even
for a lone developer.  If you get it right, confidence and satisfaction levels
soar, as does the maximum size of project you can tackle.  The biggest problem
by far with unit testing is the psychological one of getting round to it.</p>

<p>Refactoring builds on unit testing. It consists of redesigning and
reimplementing to add functionality in small stages.  Unit testing allows
components of the project to be upgraded quickly and confidently, confirming
that old functionality has been accurately reconstructed.</p>

<p>An important aspect of development which is surprisingly rarely mentioned in
tutorials or textbooks or courses, is avoiding unnecessary cyclic dependencies.
This allows components to be refactored in a specific order, with each being
upgraded and unit tested in turn.  A group of cyclically dependent components
must either all be handled as one big unit, or over-complex mocking techniques
must be used to separate their development. Tools such as <a
href="https://github.com/csijh/java-depend">depend</a> or <a
href="http://www.dependency-analyzer.org/">CDA</a> can be useful to keep track
of dependencies.  So, in this project, cyclic dependencies will be avoided.</p>

<p>A project design is often cleaner and clearer if general issues which could
potentially be reused in other projects are separated from issues which are
specific to the current project.  So, classes in this project are divided into
framework and custom classes, with framework classes not depending on custom
classes.</p>

<p>Some effort has been made to move complexities into framework classes, where
that allows custom classes to be kept simple. But the framework is not fully
general, polished, documented, or versioned, as it should be to become a fully
general purpose facility.  Developers can use this framework, but they must be
prepared to understand, adapt or upgrade the framework classes.</p>
