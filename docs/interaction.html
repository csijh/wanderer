<h1>Interaction</h1>

<p>How do entities interact with each other when they meet?  Since we are now
talking about the implementation of custom classes rather than framework
classes, it is important to explore different possibilities.  Different users of
the framework might well make different choices.</p>

<p>One approach is to represent entities using a single class, with each entity
object containing a character code or enumerated constant to specify its type.
When an entity accesses another entity, the type of the second entity can be
used to decide what to do, e.g.:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    switch (other.type()) {
        case Space: ... break;
        case Star: ... break;
        default: ... break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>A simple example of this is in the maze package.  Two classes,
<code>Item</code> (which is the equivalent of <code>Entity</code>) and
<code>Maze</code> implement a maze game, which is a simple cut-down version of
wanderer.  There are disadvantages of this approach in larger projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>switch statements can proliferate in entity classes</li>
<li>methods can get bloated as switch cases expand</li>
<li>the approach doesn't feel very object oriented</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p>Suppose instead that each type of entity is represented by a separate class,
with <code>Entity</code> as a base class. Then it is easy to imagine trying to
use switch statements like this:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    switch (other.getClass()) {
        case Space: ... break;
        case Star: ... break;
        default: ... break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This doesn't work because you can't switch on classes in Java. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch#Single_and_multiple_dispatch">Dynamic
dispatch</a> is the preferred way of deciding which class an object has within a
family.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor
pattern</a> is designed to be used when dynamic dispatch is desired on method
arguments but, as with Java, the language doesn't support that.  In this case,
only a fairly simple version of the visitor pattern is needed. Two methods can
be set up, <code>meet</code> and <code>isMetBy</code>, say, which can be used
like this:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    other.isMetBy(this);
}

void meet(Space s) { ... }

void meet(Star s) { ... }

void meet(Entity e) { ... }
</pre>

<p>The <code>isMetBy</code> function acts like a switch, and the overloaded
variants of the <code>meet</code> function form the cases, with the
<code>Entity</code> version acting as a default.  Comparing this with the usual
notation in descriptions of the visitor pattern, <code>isMetBy</code> is the
equivalent of <code>accept</code>, and <code>meet</code> is the equivalent of
<code>visit</code>.</p>

<p>Some extra code is required to set this up.  Each entity class needs to
include a one-line definition of <code>isMetBy</code>:</p>

<pre>void isMetBy(Entity e) { e.meet(this); }
</pre>

<p>Despite the definition being the same in every class, it has to be overridden
in each class rather than being defined just once in the base
<code>Entity</code> class, because it is important that the compiler should know
that the variable <code>this</code> has the desired specific class, not
just class <code>Entity</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, in the base <code>Entity</code> class, the <code>meet</code>
method variants need to be given default implementations:</p>

<pre>void meet(Space e) { meet((Entity) e); }
void meet(Star e) { meet((Entity) e); }
...
void meet(Entity e) {}
</pre>

<p>These definitions ensure that, in each entity class, not all the variants
need to be overridden, and the ones that aren't end up calling the
<code>Entity</code> variant.</p>

<p>This use of the visitor pattern does have some drawbacks.</p>

<ul>
<li>boilerplate code is needed in each class</li>
<li>other methods might need their own visitor pattern systems</li>
<li>different types of entity can't easily share classes</li>
<li>all the entity classes become cyclically dependent</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Compromise</h2>

<p>A compromise is possible in which the code in each entity class looks like
this:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    meet(other);
}

void meetSpace(Entity s) { ... }

void meetStar(Entity s) { ... }

void meetEntity(Entity e) { ... }
</pre>

<p>The <code>meet</code> function is defined in the <code>Entity</code> class,
using a switch on the type of its argument.  But there is only one switch shared
by all the classes, instead of one switch per class.  The methods
<code>meetSpace</code> etc. are given default implementations in the
<code>Entity</code> class as before.  The code in each of the <code>meet</code>
variants only knows that the <code>other</code> entity has class
<code>Entity</code>, not its specific class, but that is a minor drawback.  It
is worth it to be able to compile the entity classes one by one.</p>

<p>This compromise approach is illustrated in the <code>wanderer</code> package.
Many different inert types of entity are handled by a simgle <code>Thing</code>
class.</p>
