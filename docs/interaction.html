<h1>Interaction</h1>

<p>How do entities interact with each other when they meet?  Since we are now
talking about the implementation of custom classes rather than framework
classes, it is important to explore different possibilities.  Different users of
the framework might well make different choices.</p>

<p>One approach is to represent entities using a single class, with each entity
object containing a character code or enumerated constant to specify its type.
When an entity accesses another entity, the type of the second entity can be
used to decide what to do, e.g.:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    switch (other.type()) {
        case Space: ... break;
        case Star: ... break;
        default: ... break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>A simple example of this is in the maze package.  Two classes,
<code>Item</code> (which is the equivalent of <code>Entity</code>) and
<code>Maze</code> implements a maze game, a simple cut-down version of
wanderer.</p>

<h3>Visitors</h3>

<p>Suppose instead that each type of entity is represented by a separate class,
with <code>Entity</code> as a base class. Then it is easy to imagine trying to
use switch statements like this:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    switch (other.getClass()) {
        case Space: ... break;
        case Star: ... break;
        default: ... break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This doesn't work because you can't switch on classes in Java.  Besides,
switch statements are generally regarded as a weakness in this sort of
situation.  That is partly because methods tend to become bloated as the cases
swell, and partly because <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch#Single_and_multiple_dispatch">dynamic
dispatch</a> is the preferred way of deciding which class an object has within a
family.  It is also because, in each of the cases, the variable
<code>other</code> still only has class <code>Entity</code>, and might need to
be cast to the required class.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor
pattern</a> is designed to handle situations like this.  Often, descriptions of
the visitor pattern are complicated by having two collections of classes, or
applications involving tree nodes or similar.  In the current situation, there
aren't any of these extra complications.</p>

<p>Suppose two methods are set up, <code>meet</code> and <code>isMetBy</code>,
which we can use like this:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    other.isMetBy(this);
}

void meet(Space s) { ... }

void meet(Star s) { ... }

void meet(Entity e) { ... }
</pre>

<p>The <code>isMetBy</code> function acts like a switch, and the overloaded
variants of the <code>meet</code> function forms the cases, with the
<code>Entity</code> version acting as a default.  Comparing this with the usual
notation in the visitor pattern, <code>isMetBy</code> is the equivalent of
<code>accept</code>, and <code>meet</code> is the equivalent of
<code>visit</code>.</p>

<p>Some extra code is required to set this up.  Each entity class needs to
include a one-line definition of <code>isMetBy</code>:</p>

<pre>void isMetBy(Entity e) { e.meet(this); }
</pre>

<p>Despite the definition being the same in every class, it has to be overridden
in each class rather than being defined just once in the base
<code>Entity</code> class, because it is important that the variable
<code>this</code> should have the desired specific class, not just class
<code>Entity</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, in the base <code>Entity</code> class, the <code>meet</code>
method variants need to be given default implementations:</p>

<pre>void meet(Space e) { meet((Entity) e); }
void meet(Star e) { meet((Entity) e); }
...
void meet(Entity e) {}
</pre>

<p>These definitions ensure that, in each entity class, not all the variants
need to be overridden, and the ones that aren't end up calling the
<code>Entity</code> variant.</p>

<p>This visitor pattern approach is illustrated in the <code>wanderer</code>
package, which implements the full wanderer game.  But this use of the visitor
pattern does have some drawbacks.</p>

<ul>
<li>setting up the visitor pattern involves adding boilerplate code</li>
<li>each relevant method needs its own visitor pattern system</li>
<li>different types of entity can't easily share classes</li>
<li>all the entity classes become cyclically dependent</li>
</ul>

<p>These are worth investigating in a bit more detail, one by one.</p>

<h4>Boilerplate code</h4>

<p>The extra boilerplate code comes from the fact that Java doesn't support <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch">double dispatch</a>.  In
this project, the overhead is not great. There are a few lines of code needed in
<code>Entity</code>, but only one line of code needs to copied and pasted into
each class which extends <code>Entity</code>.</p>

<h4>Multiple methods</h4>

<p>The work done above only supports a single <code>meet</code> method.  If
there were another important two-entity method needed such as
<code>talkTo</code>, an extra set of boilerplate code would need to be
added.</p>

<p>It is convenient for an object to have a type which can be used in relatively
infrequent situations where it isn't worth setting up a separate visitor pattern
system. The ideal would be to be able to make calls like:</p>

<pre>... mutate(Space) ...
... other.is(Space) ...
</pre>

<p>It would be awkward to implement methods like this if the type of an entity
were its class, because little can be done with a class object without
reflection.  It makes more sense for the type of an object to be a character
code, an enumerated constant, or a sample entity. If character codes are used,
for example, synonyms can be defined in the <code>Entity</code> class to be used
as types:</p>

<pre>static final char Space = ...
</pre>

<p>These type names can be the same as the corresponding class names. The Java
compiler can distinguish the two uses of the same name by context.  Defining the
names as static constants in <code>Entity</code> means that all the entity
classes can access them without an import statement.</p>

<h4>Sharing classes</h4>

<p>In the <code>wanderer</code> package, more than half of the entity types are
inert, with a negligible amount of specific code.  Arguably, these should share
the same class.</p>

<p>So, the wanderer package illustrates a hybrid system. Each type of entity is
represented by a separate class, except that all the inert entity types are
represented by a single <code>Thing</code> class.  A <code>Thing</code> entity
holds a character code as a field to distinguish the different types.  Methods
in the <code>Thing</code> class, and <code>meet(Thing t)</code> variants of the
<code>meet</code> method in other classes, use the character code as a type to
test or switch on.</p>

<h4>Cyclic dependencies</h4>

<p>Entity types are likely to have a natural implicit cyclic dependency, because
of entities needing to know about each other, whether or not their classes have
a technical cyclic dependency from a Java compilation point of view.</p>

<p>That means, no matter what choice is made, it probably isn't practical to do
unit testing on each entity class individually, especially since what most needs
to be tested is the interaction between entities.  So, it makes sense to test
the entity classes as a whole.</p>

<p>That still leaves a minor awkwardness when recompiling entity classes during
refactoring.  However, by judiciously commenting out code, dependencies on
currently broken classes can be temporarily removed to help with this.  This is
a fairly minor annoyance.</p>

<p>Looking at it from another point of view, suppose that a developer wants to
avoid the visitor pattern, do all decision making using types, and have no
cyclic dependencies.  What is the best that can be done?  Switch statements
could be written like this:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    switch(other.type()) {
        case Space: meetSpace(); break;
        case Star: meetStar(); break;
        default: meetEntity(); break;
    }
}

void meetSpace(Entity s) { ... }

void meetStar(Entity s) { ... }

void meetEntity(Entity e) { ... }
</pre>

<p>Switch statements don't get too messy if each is a one-line method call.
However, it is possible to do better still.</p>

<p>Suppose the variants of the <code>meet</code> method are given default
implementations in the <code>Entity</code> class, as with the visitor pattern.
Then a single shared switch statement can be implemented in a method,
<code>meetType</code> say, in the <code>Entity</code> class, and the code
in other classes becomes:</p>

<pre>void act() {
    Entity other = find(...);
    meetType(other);
}

void meetSpace(Entity s) { ... }

void meetStar(Entity s) { ... }

void meetEntity(Entity e) { ... }
</pre>

<p>This has almost all the good properties of the visitor pattern, and avoids
cyclic dependencies. The only minor weakness is that other entities are always
in variables of class <code>Entity</code> rather than their specific class.</p>
