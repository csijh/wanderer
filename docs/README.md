# Wanderer
The Wanderer project provides three things:

- a reconstruction of a 1980's game</li>
- a framework for simple grid-based games</li>
- a case study in object oriented design and development</li>

To play the game, download
[wanderer.jar](../wanderer.jar) and run
it by double clicking or typing:
```
java -jar wanderer.jar
```

To use the framework, clone or download the whole project, read and use the
model and view packages, and write a game-specific package, using the maze and
wanderer packages as examples.  The main purpose of the framework is to provide
a case study for teaching, so the framework is not polished and documented as a
library would be.

To read about the case study, follow these links.
