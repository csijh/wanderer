The Wanderer project provides three things:

- a reconstruction of a 1980's game
- a framework for simple grid-based games
- a case study in object oriented design and development

## Wanderer: the game

The Wanderer game was written by Steven Shipway in the 1980s.  This
reconstruction was written by Ian Holyer in the 2010s.

To play the reconstructed game, download
[wanderer.jar](https://github.com/csijh/wanderer/raw/master/wanderer.jar)
and run it by double clicking or typing:
```
java -jar wanderer.jar
```

The original version (written in C) can be obtained from
[http://www.steveshipway.org/software/wanderer/f_wanderer.html](http://www.steveshipway.org/software/wanderer/f_wanderer.html)

## Wanderer: the framework

The framework is also called Wanderer. To use the framework, clone or download
the whole project, read and use the model and view packages, and write a
game-specific package, using the maze and wanderer packages as examples.  The
main purpose of the framework is to provide a case study for teaching, so the
framework is not polished and documented as a library would be.
