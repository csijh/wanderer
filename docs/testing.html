<h1>Unit testing</h1>

<p>Unit testing needs to be sorted out before implementing any classes, even if
writing actual tests isn't going to start yet. IDEs or unit testing frameworks
such as JUnit can be used (and it is a good idea to look into them for ideas, at
least). But what is the simplest approach that works properly?</p>

<p>For small classes, testing can be done in a <code>main</code> method in the
class itself. Java's assertions could be used, but are complicated by the need
for the <code>-ea</code> flag.  So it seems simpler to avoid assertions and
define classes like this:</p>

<pre>class X {
    static void claim(boolean b) { if (!b) throw new Error("Bug"); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        claim(2+2 == 4);
        System.out.println("Class X OK");
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>claim</code> method is roughly equivalent to Java's
<code>assert</code> keyword. This is all that is necessary for the current
project.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>This simple approach to testing can be developed further in various ways.
For example, rather than call <code>claim(s.equals("x"))</code>, it might be
preferable to use <code>claimEq(s, "x")</code>.  The <code>claimEq</code> method
can be written:</p>

<pre>static void claimEq(Object x, Object y) {
    if (x == y) return;
    if (x != null &amp;&amp; x.equals(y)) return;
    throw new Error("Bug");
}
</pre>

<p>Because of the boxing/unboxing feature of Java, this works for primitive
types, e.g. integers and characters, as well as objects which have a suitable
<code>equals</code> method. (However, as it stands, it doesn't work for
arrays).</p>

<p>If you do want to use Java's assertions, you can test whether they have been
switched on like this:</p>

<pre>...
public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean testing = false;
    assert(testing = true);
    if (! testing) System.err.println("You forgot the -ea flag");
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>Note the argument to the assert call is an assignment <code>testing =
true</code> not a comparison <code>testing == true</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>main</code> method approach to unit testing can also be scaled up
to large projects, by defining classes something like this:</p>

<pre>class X implements Testable {
    public String test(String in) { ... }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test.run(args, new X());
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>Testable</code> interface describes a <code>test</code> method
which takes a test expressed as a string and returns a string result which can
be checked against what is expected. The <code>test</code> method may be
effectively static, creating any objects it needs, but is not <em>declared</em>
<code>static</code>, so that it can be described by the interface.</p>

<p>Shared test code is put into a general <code>Test</code> class, which doesn't
depend directly on any of the project classes, only on the <code>Testable</code>
interface, so that a class can be tested when other classes that it doesn't
depend on are broken. The <code>run</code> method has the signature:</p>

<pre>static run(String[] args, Testable sample) { ... }
</pre>

<p>The object passed as the second argument is just a sample object used by the
<code>Test</code> class to access the <code>test</code> method. The battery of
tests for a class is put into a text file, which is read and interpreted by the
<code>Test</code> class.</p>
