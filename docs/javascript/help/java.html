<h1>The Java Version</h1>

<p>The first version was written in Java, and is where the bulk of the
reconstruction work was done. The other versions were relatively easy to develop
after that.</p>

<h3>Visibility</h3>

<p>Originally, all the classes were together in one package.  That means that
everything in a class which was not made private was visible to all the other
classes.</p>

<p>One design principle that was followed in the code was that entities should
have only a few standard methods which are called from non-entity classes and
which define their behaviour.  The entity classes all inherit from a base
Entity class which provides utility methods to simplify the code in the
subclasses.  These utility methods should, strictly speaking, be visible to the
subclasses, but not to any of the non-entity classes.  Java famously doesn't
provide a keyword which makes things visible to subclasses but not the other
classes in the same package.</p>

<p>For a project of this size, with a single programmer, this issue is hardly
worth worrying about. You can rely on self-control to avoid calling utility
methods from the wrong classes. After all, the design principle is only for your
own benefit anyway. However, if anyone else is ever going to use the code, it is
much better to enforce the restriction so that they can't accidently violate the
principle. What is more, if anyone else is ever going to read the code, you
don't want to set a bad example.</p>

<p>So, all the entity classes were moved into a
subpackage, <kbd>wanderer.entity</kbd>, and only the base Entity class itself
was made public.  Within the Entity class, only the main behaviour methods were
made public.  This refactoring step involved dealing with a lot of details to
do with visibility modifiers, import statements, and package paths.  However,
it meant that the entity class files were neatly separated from the others in a
separate directory, and it showed up a number of poor pieces of code.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<p>One of the design aims was to separate out the graphics interface code from
the other code, so that testing could be done without starting up a graphics
interface.  At one point, it was found that even though it appeared that the
graphics had been separated out, testing couldn't be done over an ssh
connection because Java was attempting to initialize its graphics subsystem
when no graphics system was available.</p>

<p>The desire to run testing over a non-graphics remote connection was not an
important one.  However, it is a great way to check whether graphics code has
in fact been successfully separated out.  It is quite a strict check because
Java attempts to initialize its graphics system whenever any graphics class is
used, not just when a GUI is created.</p>

<p>One issue that arises is how to store an entity's icon.  The Entity class,
which is clearly needed during non-graphics testing, cannot have a field of
type ImageIcon, which is a graphics class.  So, if an entity doesn't contain
its own icon, where is it stored?  It should be stored in the Display class,
which is essentially the only one that deals with graphics.  It is wasteful to
have a separate icon per entity, so the Display class should contain some kind
of map from the type of an entity to its appropriate icon.</p>

<p>However, we don't want the Display class to know what entity types there are.
That should be local to the entity classes, to avoid duplication and maintenance
effort, and to make the Display class independent so that it can in principle be
reused in other similar projects. So, instead of a map from entity types to
icons, the Display class contains a map from icon names such as
<code>"wall"</code> to icons, with each entity storing the name of its own icon
in the map. The Display class itself does not know what icon names exist and
does not contain any explicit mention of particular icon names.</p>
