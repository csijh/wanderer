<h1>Objects</h1>

<p>In an object oriented design, it is natural for each entity in the
grid to be an object which is responsible for its own behaviour, with
code written from its own point of view.  The reconstruction takes
this approach, with each type of entity defining its own specific
behaviour.</p>

<p>How should blank squares be represented?  A lot of programmers would almost
automatically make them nulls.  However, this is not very object oriented.
Instead of having code which asks each object questions or tells it to act
without knowing which kind of object it is, you have to write code which tests
the object for being null first, before deciding what to do.  It is much better
to make spaces into objects as well - they are just objects with a particularly
simple behaviour.  (They just give way to any other entity which wants to move
into their cell.)</p>

<p>It might be worth noting that while using nulls instead of objects
is a bad idea in an object oriented language such as Java, it is far
less of a problem in a lower level language like C.  That is because
in C you can call a function <tt>act(object)</tt> and the function can
test for null, whereas in an OO language, you can't write the
equivalent <tt>object.act()</tt> without testing for null first in the
calling code.  Even so, objects are used rather than nulls in the C
reconstruction, for uniformity.</p>
