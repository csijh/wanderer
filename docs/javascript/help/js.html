<h1>The JavaScript Version</h1>

<p>The JavaScript version allows the game to be played online, and acts as a
demo of the HTML5 canvas element.</p>

<p>The translation uses a few of the object oriented techniques of the original
Java version, but without being too strict about it.</p>

<p>Following <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/private.html">Douglas
Crockford's notes</a>, classes with private fields are implemented using this
style:</p>

<pre>
function Constructor()
{
  var self = this;
  var privateField1;
  var privateField2;

  this.publicMethod1 = method1;
  this.publicMethod2 = method2;

  function method1(...) { ... }
  function method2(...) { ... }

  function privateMethod3(...) { ... }
  function privateMethod4(...) { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>This is quite helpful in matching the structure of the original Java code,
but has some disadvantages. One is that the keyword <code>this</code> can't be
used properly, because of a 'bug' in JavaScript, hence the <code>self</code>
field. Another is that conventional JavaScript debugging can't be used, because
the private fields aren't visible to the debugger. A final one is that the
scheme doesn't mix well with JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance mechanism.
The final one is that the technique uses more memory - the private fields of an
object are held in a separate closure object. Despite these potential
disadvantages, this approach does help with robust development.</p>
