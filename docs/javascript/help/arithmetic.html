<h1>Coordinate arithmetic</h1>

<p>Object oriented design seems to suggest that entities in the grid
need to do coordinate calculations all the time to check neighbouring
grid cells, to decide what to do or to move.  On the other hand,
object oriented design also suggests that since coordinate
calculations are likely to be widespread and repetitive, they should
be isolated in a single place and implemented only once.  So should
entities know their own coordinates, or not?</p>

<p>Another problem with entities knowing where they are, e.g. by having x, y
coordinates as fields, is that a duplicate data problem arises.  An entity has
a position through being in the grid array, and it has a position through
having coordinate fields - how do you know they agree?</p>

<p>A good compromise is for the grid to be the only object which handles raw
coordinates and coordinate arithmetic, and for entities to interact with the
grid using directions (<tt>Up</tt>, <tt>Down</tt> etc). This centralizes
coordinate calculations, helps to ensure consistency in a bullet-proof way, and
yet gives entities their autonomy.</p>

<p>Two different techniques are used in the reconstructions to achieve this. One
is for entities not to hold coordinates. Instead, the grid object has a map
which maps entities to their coordinates. As a result, only the grid has access
to raw coordinates.</p>

<p>Another approach (used in the C reconstruction) is for the grid module to
define the entity structure, which includes coordinates, but to export it as an
opaque type. The grid also provides a small number of general primitive
operations which entities can use to interact with the grid. The code which
defines the behaviour of different types of entity can only use the primitive
operations, and not access the coordinates directly.</p>
