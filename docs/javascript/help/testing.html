<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>As the program was developed, some relatively minor testing was done to
begin with.  But it was only when the program started to come together that
more extensive robust testing was designed.  This involved adding recording and
playback features.  Changes to the grid are recorded in a text file as a level
is played by hand.  Manual testing consists of replaying a level and comparing
it to playing the original version.  Automated (regression) testing consists of
replaying all the recordings, with graphics and interaction switched off, and
checking that the same effects are obtained.</p>

<p>When it came to implementing the testing, good design up to that point paid
off and made it easy. All changes to the grid were made by a call to a single
specific method. That made it easy to adapt that method to record the change.
When it came to automatic playback, the fact that the graphical display of the
grid had been separated from the logic and storage of the grid contents made it
easy to switch off graphics and interaction.</p>

<p>Of course, it is impossible to test everything. There is only one known
difference in logical behaviour from the original version, made deliberately to
prevent baby monsters from moving outside the playing area, but there could be
more. However, the testing guarantees that every level is solvable. A couple of
the tests are included with each version of the program.</p>
