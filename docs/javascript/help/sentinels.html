<h1>Sentinels</h1>

<p>Every time new coordinates are calculated by adding an offset, the resulting
coordinates, in principle, have to be checked to see if they are within the
grid.</p>

<p>In the reconstruction, sentinels are used, which in this case means
putting a wall as a border round the outside of the level grid.  Doing
this in the grid array in memory avoids the need for any out-of-bounds
tests.</p>

<p>The surrounding wall need not necessarily appear either in the level file or
on screen, but it turned out to be convenient for it to be included in both.  A
little translation program was used to convert the level files to add the
border.</p>
