<h1>Coordinates</h1>

<p>There are three coordinate systems in common use in mathematics and computer
science, so it is quite important to be clear about which one you are
using.  They are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Geometry coordinates, with x across and y up.</li>

<li>Matrix coordinates, with y down and x across (better named as row,column or
r,c than y,x).</li>

<li>Graphics coordinates, with x across and y down.</li>

</ul>

<p>In computer science, the third of these is very common, probably
because it is a compromise between thinking of the screen as a
geometrical space and as a matrix of pixels at the same time.  The
reconstruction uses graphics coordinates throughout the code, though
some resources such as level files use matrix coordinates.</p>

<p>The original game used graphics x, y coordinates, except when
communicating with the curses library which uses matrix coordinates,
so you see <tt>screen[y][x]</tt> a lot in the original code.</p>
