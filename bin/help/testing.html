<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>As the program was developed, some relatively minor testing was done to
begin with.  But it was only when the program started to come together that
more extensive robust testing was designed.  This involved adding recording and
replaying features.  Changes to the grid are recorded in a text file as a level
is played by hand.  Manual testing consists of replaying a level and comparing
it to playing the original version.  Automated (regression) testing consists of
replaying all the recordings, with graphics and interaction switched off, and
checking that the same effects are obtained.</p>

<p>When it came to implementing the testing, good design up to that point paid
off and made it easy. The fact that each change to the grid could only be made
by a call to a single specific method made it easy to adapt that method to
record the change. When it came to automatic replay, the fact that the
graphical display of the grid had been separated from the logic and storage of
the grid contents made it easy to switch off graphics and interaction.</p>

<p>Of course, it is impossible to test everything. There are known differences
in behaviour, made deliberately to make the game more logical, but there could
be more. However, the testing guarantees that every level is playable and
solvable. A couple of the tests are included in the Java jar file.</p>
