# Differences from the original
[Back](Wanderer)
-
All 60 levels can be successfully solved, in the same way as in the original
game. However, not all the features of the original game have been implemented,
and one or two things have been changed.
-
Images are used instead of characters to represent the levels on screen. On some
levels (e.g. 7, 14, 24, 31) the original screen had characters which spelt out
readable words. These are no longer readable. A couple of levels (e.g. 52) had
extra inactive monsters, used to spell out words. They have been removed.
-
Levels are now surrounded by walls. Baby monsters are not allowed to move onto
walls, and therefore they can't move outside the playing area (as could happen
in the original level 41, which has been changed slightly).
-
In the original game, the player occasionally dies with no discernible direct
cause (because of the order in which various checks are made).  This behaviour
hasn't been reproduced.
-
There is no password system for going between levels. The levels have a slightly
different format from the original. There is no level editor.
-
The arrow keys and w,a,s,d are supported as well as the original h,j,k,l, but
there is no way to redefine the keys.
-
Bombs and thingies haven't been implemented - but neither of them appear in any
of the standard 60 levels.
