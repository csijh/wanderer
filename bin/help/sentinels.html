<h1>Sentinels</h1>

<p>Every time new coordinates are calculated by adding an offset, the resulting
coordinates, in principle, have to be checked to see if they are within the
grid.</p>

<p>In the reconstruction, sentinels are used, which in this case means putting
a wall round the outside of the level grid. Although there is still an
out-of-bounds test, it is in one place and it results in an error being
reported.</p>

<p>The surrounding wall need not necessarily appear either in the level file or
on screen, but it turned out to be convenient for it to be included in both.  A
little translation program was used to convert the level files to add the
border, in addition to other minor changes.</p>
