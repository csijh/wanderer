<h1>Physics</h1>

<p>When the player moves, this may trigger arrows to fly, boulders to fall, and
so on.  The behaviour of these various objects is relatively simple, but the
order in which things happen is not so simple.  The original program uses
recursion to deal with the way in which one event triggers another.  The result
is a slight loss of realism (not that the game is all that realistic in the
first place).</p>

<p>For example, if you move near two objects, say an arrow and a boulder, and
set them going, the entire flight of the arrow and everything it triggers,
happens before the boulder moves.  In other words, the program is doing a
depth-first search for things to do.  It is more normal to keep a list of
things to do, and to use it as a queue to give a more concurrent, breadth-first
physics.</p>

<p>The reconstruction uses the list approach rather than recursion.  However,
to reproduce the game as accurately as possible, it uses the list as a stack
rather than as a queue.  This gives the same effect as recursion, but
makes it easy to switch to a queue to investigate the difference.</p>
