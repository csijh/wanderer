# Wanderer
The Wanderer project provides three things:

- a reconstruction of a 1980's game
- a framework for simple grid-based games
- a case study in object oriented design and development

To play the game, either try the JavaScript version
[online](https://github.com/csijh/wanderer/raw/master/javascript/index.html)
or download the Java version
[wanderer.jar](https://github.com/csijh/wanderer/raw/master/wanderer.jar)
and run it by double clicking or typing:
```
java -jar wanderer.jar
```
