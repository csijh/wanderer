# Wanderer
The Wanderer project provides three things:

- a reconstruction of a 1980's game</li>
- a framework for simple grid-based games</li>
- a case study in object oriented design and development</li>

To play the game, download
[wanderer.jar](../wanderer.jar) and run
it by double clicking or typing:
```
java -jar wanderer.jar
```
