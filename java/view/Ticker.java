/* Ticker class. Free and open source: see licence.txt.

This is an animation timer, controlling the level and calling a provided method
whenever redrawing is needed.  User commands are given to the timer, queued up
for later execution if an animation is in progress, and passed on to the level.
The provided method is called with a null ActionEvent argument.

Animations only occur just after the user has pressed a key.  And since entities
move one cell at a time rather than smoothly, animation steps need not be very
frequent.  So to avoid unnecessary processing (especially on mobile devices)
fast animation, e.g. with AnimationTimer, is not used. Instead, PauseTransition
is used to sleep for one tick when needed.

Since pauses can be quite long, an extra unnecessary pause may be perceptible to
the user.  So, first level.step() is called, then the boolean result is checked
to see if anything actually happened.  If the result is false, there is no
pause.  If the result is true, a pause triggered, followed by a call to the
provided method to make the change visible. */
